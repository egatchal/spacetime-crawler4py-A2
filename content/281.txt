<h5> Course Description </h5> 
Students in this project class will work in teams to develop 
artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms with a particular focus on natural language and text analysis. These problems can include, for example, document classification 
and clustering, sentiment analysis, dialog/chatbot systems, information extraction, word prediction, text synthesis, question-answering systems,
and so on. Projects can make use of real-world publicly-available data from sources such as Twitter, Wikipedia, Reddit, news articles, 
product and movie reviews, email data sets, the US patent database, and more. </br>
<b>Note:</b> this offering of CS 175 will focus on text/natural-language aspects of AI. If you are interested in other topics (e.g., game-playing agents, computer vision, etc) you may want to  take a different offering of this course in Winter or Spring quarter.

<h6> Academic Integrity </h6> 
Please read the guidelines on academic integrity below. Academic integrity is taken seriously in this class.  
<ul>
<li> Failure to adhere to the policies below can result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class.  
</li>
<li> <b>For individual assignments</b> you are allowed to discuss the assignments verbally (no written communication) with other class members. You are not allowed to look at or to copy anyone else's written solutions or code. 
All problem solutions and code submitted must be material you have personally written during 
this quarter, except for any standard publicly-available library or utility functions. </li>
<li> <b> For team projects</b> all the text in your <b>reports</b>  must be written by you or members of your project team. If you wish to quote text from another source you need to clearly indicate this by putting it in within quotation marks or in italic font and providing a citation to the source. 
The <b>code</b> that you use for your class projects will be a combination of code written by you and your team members and publicly-available library code. You should clearly indicate in your reports and in your
code documentation which parts of your code was written by you or your team
and which parts of your code were imported from somewhere else. </li> 
<li>  It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with 
<a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/index.php">UCI's Academic Integrity Policies</a>
and
<a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/students/academic-integrity/definitions.php"> UCI's definitions and examples of
academic misconduct</a>.
