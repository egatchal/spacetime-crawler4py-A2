<p>
<h6> Background knowledge for taking this class </h6>
Knowledge of basic concepts in probability, multivariate calculus, and linear algebra are important for this course. 
A good understanding of basic concepts in probability is particularly important.  <br>
<b> NOTE:</b> if you are not sure whether you have the relevant background or not, please read Chapters 5.1 to 5.5 and 6.1 to 6.5 in   <a href="https://mml-book.github.io/"><b> Mathematics for Machine Learning</b></a>: you should be comfortable with this material to take this class. 
Alternatively, if you have already taken some ML and/or statistics courses, its possible that this course might mostly cover material you already know: please read the <a href="syllabus.html">course syllabus</a> to make sure this course is matched to your interests.
</p>

<h6> Course Goals </h6>
Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of probabilistic approaches to machine learning. 
Probabilistic learning is a key component in many areas within modern computer science, 
including artificial intelligence, data mining, speech recognition, computer vision, bioinformatics, and so forth. 
The course will provide a tutorial introduction to the basic principles of probabilistic modeling and then 
demonstrate the application of these principles to the analysis, development, and practical 
use of machine learning algorithms.  Topics covered will include probabilistic modeling, 
defining likelihoods, parameter estimation using likelihood and Bayesian techniques, 
probabilistic approaches to classification, clustering, and regression, and related topics 
such as model selection and bias/variance tradeoffs. References to approaches such as deep learning will be mentioned where appropriate, but be aware that this is not a course that goes into depth on deep learning methods.
</p>

<p>
<h6> Grading Policy </h6>
Final grades will be based on a combination of homework assignments and exams: 50% homeworks, 20% midterm, and 30% final. 
Your lowest scoring homework will be dropped and not included in your score. No credit for late homeworks.  
</p>

<p>
<h6> Academic Integrity </h6>
Students are expected to be read and be familiar with the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/courses/academic_integrity">Academic
Integrity Policy</a> for this class. 
Failure to adhere to this policy can result in a student receiving a failing grade in the class.
