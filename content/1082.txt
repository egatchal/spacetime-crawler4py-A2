<br>
Before joining UC Irvine in 2018, I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2018), working with Professor Arvind. 
I have earned my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University (2010).
<h2> Research Interests </h2>
My research is in <em>innovative system architectures for low-cost high-performance computing</em>.<br>
My two prominent tools right now are <em>Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)</em> and <em>reconfigurable hardware accelerators</em>.<br>
<br>
<!--<b>I am looking for students interested in building affordable systems that outperform supercomputers!</b>-->
<br>
<br>


<h2>Software Distributions</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href=https://github.com/sangwoojun/sortreduce>libsortreduce</a> Library implementing the Sort-Reduce algorithm for sequentializing random updates into secondary storage, introduced in the <a href=papers/isca2018-camera.pdf>GraFBoost</a> paper.
<li> <a href=https://github.com/sangwoojun/sortreduce/tree/master/examples/graph>GraFBoost / BigSparse</a> Graph analytics platform for handling very large graphs quickly using secondary storage, built using libsortreduce.
