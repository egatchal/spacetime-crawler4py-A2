	  I direct the Trustworthy Systems Lab (TrussLab).
          Our lab's research involves building trustworthy systems.
          Our projects are often at the intersection of mobile computing, security, and operating systems.
	</p>
        <p>
	  I joined the CS department at UC Irvine in July 2015.
	  I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the ECE department at Rice
	  University, and my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology.
	  Since joining UCI, I have received the NSF CAREER Award, Google's Android Security and PrIvacy REsearch (ASPIRE) Award, and UCI ICS Dean's Mid-Career Award for Research.

	<h2>Prospective Students</h2>
        <p>
	  I'm always looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students who enjoy building systems to join our lab. If you're interested, send me an email or drop by my office.
