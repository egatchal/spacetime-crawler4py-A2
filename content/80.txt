<h2><b>Michael Shindler</b></h2>
I am an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the <a href="http://www.cs.uci.edu">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a>.
<br /><br />

Office: DBH 4058<br /><br />

If you want to meet with me, for example if you are thinking of graduate school and want to discuss it, and would otherwise drop by my office hours, but aren't in my class this term, please send me an email and I will try to find time to meet with you.

 <br /><br />

To form my email address:

<ul>
	<li>
For course-related topics, concatenate <tt>mikes</tt> with <tt>[at] ics [dot] uci [dot] edu</tt>
	</li>
	<li>
		For all other topics, concatenate <tt>mikes</tt> with <tt>[at] uci [dot] edu</tt>
</ul>
My research focuses primarily on educational issues in computer science;  I am particularly interested in issues related to teaching Computer Science Theory courses, such as identifying and correcting student misconceptions in these courses and also discovering concept inventories.  I am also interested in more general issues involving the scaling of class sizes and making efficient use of resources for student learning.  

<br /><br />
In the past, my computer science research touched on computations on large datasets, machine learning, approximation algorithms, streaming algorithms, and data mining.

<br /><br />

	If you are planning to ask me for a letter of recommendation, please <a href="letters.html">read this first</a>.

<h3>Teaching</h3>

For every class I teach, <I>all students are responsible for all material and due dates in the class, even those that occur prior to their enrollment.</I>  If you are planning to add the class after day one, please contact me at the start of the quarter, preferably at the conclusion of the first lecture.  You should plan to attend every lecture starting at day one, even if you are not yet enrolled.  <!-- If the class is virtual/remote, contact me for a link.--> <br /><br />

This quarter, Fall 2022, I am teaching the following courses:
<ul>
	<li><a href="ics46/">I&C SCI 46</a> : Data Structure Implementation and Analysis</li>
	<li><a href="compsci260p/">CompSci 260P</a> : Algorithms </li>
</ul>


<!-- I <I>strongly recommend</I> anyone taking my class to have a computer with an Intel (or compatible) processor.  The Virtual Machine we use for programming assignments is designed with this in mind.  If you do not own such a machine, you may use the computers in ICS1-364.  My classes will not be providing support for computers with other processors, such as M1 Macs. <br /><br /> -->

For the 2022-23 school year, I am tentatively set to teach the following courses.  These courses will be offered on-campus.  There is not currently a fully virtual option for any of these courses, nor are there plans to create one.

<ul>
	<li>Winter 2023: I&C SCI 46, CompSci 161</li>
	<li>Spring 2023: CompSci 162, CompSci 260P</li>
</ul>


In both Fall and Winter quarter, when I am teaching I&C SCI 46, the current plan is for there to be two lectures.  Students are welcome to attend either one, regardless of enrollment, with the following two exceptions:

<ul>
	<li>On exam days, you are required to take the exam in your enrolled section.</li>
	<li>If we run out of seats on non-exam days, priority for seating is for students enrolled in the section.</li>
</ul>
